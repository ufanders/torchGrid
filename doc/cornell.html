</p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my Master of Engineering project, I design
and construct a LED-based (Light-Emitting-Diode) candle simulator.&nbsp;
The candle is
<br>microcontroller-based having time-variable light output, with statistics
similar to real candles, as well as breeze sensors.&nbsp; Factors such
<br>as flame dynamics (flicker) in breezy and still air environments are
considered.</blockquote>
<a name="Objectives"></a><font size="+2">Objectives</font>
<blockquote>The project objectives will be listed and briefly described:
<p>· The primary objective is that the candle must look convincingly
like a flame.&nbsp; What must a designer consider so that the candle, as
stated previously, looks real?
<br>· The candle must have time-variable light output.&nbsp; Anyone
who looks at a candle flame will notice that it is not always periodic,
but seems to have a random component.
<br>· The candle must have breeze sensors.&nbsp; A candle dances
when subjected to light breezes, or blows out when the breeze is too strong.
<br>· Everything must be in real-time.&nbsp; How convincing would
a candle look if you blew on it, and the flicker dynamics changed 3 minutes
later?
<br>· Packaging.&nbsp; It should be packaged to look like a real
candle.
</p><p>Each of these objectives has been accomplished and will be discussed
in detail.
<br>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<a name="Flame Dynamics"></a><font size="+2">Flame Dynamics</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flame dynamics are simulated using time-variable
light output.&nbsp; In [1], Fujiwara et al found that the flame dynamics
give off a flat power spectrum at low frequencies and falls off as 1/f
n power spectrum with n = 2.12 ± 0.7 (see figure 1).&nbsp; The �n�
that Fujiwara found is not distinguishable from the slope of a one-pole
digital low pass filter.&nbsp; A simple low-pass filter has a slope of
2.0.&nbsp; Thus, I tried passing white noise through a digital low pass
filter for the respective reasons previously mentioned.

</p><p>(where �next� is an �unsigned long int�, and �finalRandomNum� is a �float�).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A uniformly distributed number between -0.5 and
0.5 is generated, with an average value of 0.
<br>The following equations are used to calculate the new number to set
the intensity of the light:

<p><img src="./cornell_files/Equation1.jpg" height="32" width="168"></p></center>

<p>adapted from [4], where w is the white noise input and alpha, a, which
serves as a �weight�, depending a smaller alpha placing more emphasis on
the white noise on the next calculation.&nbsp; Zt is the input at time
t, with an initially value of zero at t = 0.
</p><p>Alpha is calculated as follows:
</p><center>
<p><img src="./cornell_files/Equation2.jpg" height="46" width="99"></p></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alpha is calculated as specified because that is
how much the signal would decay if the filter�s impulse response were exponential
in with time constant of t.&nbsp; Dt is equally to the task 1 time of 64
milli-seconds, which determines how often the new number to set the intensity
of the light in calculated.
</p><center>
<p><img src="./cornell_files/Equation3.jpg" height="48" width="93"></p></center>

<p>therefore,
</p><center>
<p><img src="./cornell_files/Equation4.jpg" height="50" width="74"></p></center>

<p>where tau, t is a time constant.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final new number to set the intensity of the
light is calculated as follows:
</p><center>
<p><img src="./cornell_files/Equation5.jpg" height="31" width="246"></p></center>

<p>where Iscale increases the intensity of the light, with blow being a
constant that scales raw white noise, and Ioffset shifts the intensity
value.&nbsp; Ioffset is added since z will have a mean value of zero and
we want the light to stay on.&nbsp; Iscale is the average value of the
light, and blow adds in high frequency white noise that looks like flicker
when you blow on the thermistor.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The software generated white noise and the low-pass
filter controls specific hardware in the Atmel 90s8535 microcontroller
used, such as the �Pulse Width Modulator� (PWM).&nbsp; When the PWM mode
is selected, Timer/Counter1, the Output Compare Register1A (OCR1A) form
a dual 8-bit (or 9-, 10-bit), free running, glitch-free and phase-correct
PWM with outputs on the PORT D5 pin.&nbsp; [2]

<blockquote>The detection of breezes in the environment is accomplished
using a thermistor.

<br><b>Figure 2</b> � Breeze Sensor Circuit</p></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle behind a thermistor is that the resistance
changes as a function of temperature.&nbsp; As the thermistor heats up,
the resistance decreases, while the resistance increases with a decrease
in temperature.&nbsp; Enough current will heat the thermistor above ambient
temperature.&nbsp; The thermistor requires three milliwatts to heat it
one degree Celsius.&nbsp; With this bias, the temperature is approximately
50 degrees Celsius.&nbsp; The maximum power rating of the thermistor is
0.100 watts.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it is self-heated, with a gentle breeze,
the thermistor decreases in temperature, the resistance increases, and
the voltage across the 100ohm and thus, the voltage read by the analog-to-digital
converter decreases.&nbsp; The thermistor changes about 4% per degree.&nbsp;
The ADC value is represented by 8-bits.&nbsp; Approximately three bits
change when there is there is a 0.050-volt change after a breeze starts.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the breeze sensors, I used a state-machine to
change the system depending on whether the candle lies in a still-air or
breezy environment.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>State Diagram</i>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state diagram of the breeze sensor is
shown in figure 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state diagram consists primarily
of 6 states.&nbsp; I described the possible environment conditions to be
still-air, or possible with a light or strong breeze blowing.&nbsp; The
states �blow�, �light�, and �strong� contain an addition condition with
checks whether there is a breeze that is strong enough to blow out the
candle.&nbsp; When this condition occurs, the system shuts off the LED.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of each state is given:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>· �No Breeze� � There is currently no breeze blowing.&nbsp;
This state asks, �Is the voltage above a certain threshold voltage, Vt?�
If yes, enter state �Blow�, otherwise, there�s still no breeze.
<br>· �Blow� � There�s a breeze blowing.&nbsp; This state asks,
�Is the voltage change greater than VStrong?�, where VStrong is the minimum
voltage change considered to be a strong breeze.&nbsp; If yes, enter state
�Strong Breeze�, otherwise, it�s a light breeze, and so enter state �Light
Breeze�.
<br>· �Light Breeze� � There�s a light breeze blowing.&nbsp; This
state asks, �Is the voltage change greater than VStrong?�.&nbsp; If yes,
enter state �Strong Breeze�, otherwise, enter state �Light Helper�.
<br>· �Light Helper� � There�s a light breeze blowing.&nbsp; This
state determines if the voltage change is greater than Vt.&nbsp; If it
is, it�s a light breeze, otherwise, there�s no longer a breeze blowing,
so enter state �No Breeze�.
<br>· �Strong Breeze� � There�s a strong breeze blowing.&nbsp; This
state determines if the voltage change is greater than VStrong.&nbsp; If
it isn�t, enter state �Blowing�.&nbsp; If it is, remain in current state.
<br>· �Blowing� � There�s a strong breeze blowing.&nbsp; This state
asks, �Is the voltage change above Vt?�&nbsp; If it is, enter state �Light
Breeze� because the breeze is light, but if not, enter state �No Breeze�
because there�s no longer a breeze blowing.</blockquote>

<br><b>Figure 3</b> � State Machine for Breeze detection.&nbsp; The condition
for the blownout candle is detected in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong breeze, light breeze and blow states.&nbsp;
The system shuts off the LED and disables all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
interrupts when the blowout condition is met.</center>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose to use a state machine instead of a continuous
controller for two main reasons.&nbsp; The main reason being that with
a continuous controller, I would have to find a specific relationship between
the four parameters in my candle.&nbsp; Time of course was another factor,
since I wanted to have an easier time testing the complete circuit for
robustness.&nbsp; Given more time, I most definitely would have used a
continuous controller.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ADC value is read once for every 100 milli-seconds.&nbsp;
Depending on the amount of voltage change, the �no breeze�, �light breeze�,
or �strong breeze� parameters are loaded.&nbsp; I wrote specific �methods�
in my code that are executed whenever any of the previous mentioned states
are entered from a different state.&nbsp; The system interrupts are temporarily
halted and the new parameters are loaded, which then the system resumes
with the new parameters.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before using the statemachine, a period of time for
the system to settle is necessary.&nbsp; This is required since the thermistor,
with a still-air time constant of approximately one second, needs time
to heat up (and thus its resistance changes), and after it stabilizes,
the ADC value is read in, which serves as the �zero-point�.&nbsp; After
the �zero-point� is obtained, it takes approximately 200-300 milliseconds
for a change in the ADC value to stabilize.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testing the state-machine required reading the output
from the microcontroller�s RS232 connection to a PC.&nbsp; The monitor
displayed the strategically placed printout statements throughout my code
via the microcontroller�s Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter
(UART), which would tell me how much the voltage changed and which state
the system is currently in.&nbsp; Thus, I was fully aware of what was going
on in the system.</p></blockquote>

<a name="Improvements"></a><font size="+2">Improvements</font>
<blockquote>After completion of the original candle, several improvements
were made, which include:
<blockquote>1) improved flame dynamics using a statemachine
<br>2) implementation using a continuous controller
<br>3) new packaging</blockquote>

<p><br><i>flame dynamics</i>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flame dynamics of the original version
as described above did not handle extremely breezy environments well.&nbsp;
The new state machine was altered to take into account extremely long breezes.&nbsp;
The basic operating principle is simple.&nbsp; At startup, continuously
compare the current ADC value to the last five ADC values, if there are
at least three matches with the history table, the current ADC value becomes
the "Vzero" value.&nbsp; The Vzero serves as a base to compare future voltage
changes in the system.&nbsp; Previously, the original state machine waited
five seconds before taking in a reading.&nbsp; The drawback of that approach
is that if the thermistor wasn't sitting in a still air environment, the
initial reading may not be accurate, thus, the system dynamics will be
affected negatively.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, why did i chose five previous values instead
of more (or less)?.&nbsp; Four and fewer did not give a 'good' Vzero.&nbsp;
I wanted the system to have as accurate of a Vzero value as possible, yet,
not stall in the startup state on the condition when the ADC value bounces
between two values.&nbsp; At initial startup, the thermistor heats up and
the ADC changes in one direction only in a still air environment.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A specific state called "reheat" was added so that
the thermistor was fully reheated <u>before</u> calculating another voltage
change.&nbsp; This forced the system to take extremely accurate voltage
changes.&nbsp; The downside of this approach is the the system must 'reset'
to the Vzero voltage point, and this prevents the microcontroller from
detecting continuously changing breezes in the environment.&nbsp; To remedy
this, I replaced the state-machine with a continuous controller (<a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/eceprojectsland/STUDENTPROJ/2001to2002/pc59//index.htm#continuous">see
below</a>)
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state diagram with improved dynamics is as follows:

<p><img src="./cornell_files/stateDiagramImproved.JPG" height="647" width="1177">
<br><b>Figure 6</b> - State-Machine with improved dynamics.&nbsp; Notice
the added reheat state.</p></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><p><a name="continuous"></a><i>continuous controller upgrade</i>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second improvement&nbsp; replaced the
statemachine with a continuous controller.&nbsp; The continuous controller
still begins exactly like the statemachine described above, with ADC readings
and history comparisons.&nbsp; However, after the Vzero value has been
obtained, we "continuously" read the ADC value.&nbsp; I found a relationship
between the change in voltage and the four prime factors: I_offset, I_scale,
alpha, and blow.&nbsp; These parameters were previously <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/eceprojectsland/STUDENTPROJ/2001to2002/pc59//index.htm#Flame Dynamics">described</a>.&nbsp;
With increasing breeze strength, I_scale and alpha decreased, blow increased.&nbsp;
I_offset was set to an average value to prevent the amplitude from going
to zero.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage of using a continuous controller is
that the limitations of the statemachine are eliminated.&nbsp; For example,
we do not need to wait for the thermistor to fully reheat before rereading
the ADC.&nbsp; Since we don't have a statemachine, the code is much simpler.&nbsp;
The response of the system is also noticeably faster.
<br>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<i>packaging</i>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One common suggestion given by several people
in Mudd Hall was that the candle would look even better if the circuitry
and wiring were hidden from sight.&nbsp; Using a cardboard shipping tube
approxiamately 2 inches in diameter, it was cut to about 7 inches in height.&nbsp;
The circuitry and the batterypack are hidden inside, with the batteries
sitting at the bottom to serve double duty as a stabilizing weight.&nbsp;
Using white semi-glossy paint, I applied three coats so that the exterior
looked waxy, which gives the added effect of looking like a real candle.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A picture is worth a thousand words....so here's
two!

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the stated objectives has been met.&nbsp;
The packaged candle looks convincingly real, with time variable light output,
breeze sensors, and real-time response.
<br>Time-variable light output was achieved by using white noise and a
low pass filter.&nbsp; The breeze sensor was constructed using a thermistor
and an ADC.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final candle looks convincingly real according
to several people in Mudd Hall.&nbsp; If time permits, I�ll measure the
output spectrum.&nbsp; However, there�s always room for upgrades.&nbsp;
One such upgrade would involve sensitivity controls.&nbsp; Depending on
whether a certain say, button is pushed, the candle may be more sensitive
to breezes in the environment.&nbsp; Another change would involve changing
white noise to gaussian white noise.&nbsp; I believe I will implement these
changes on my own time.</p></blockquote>
